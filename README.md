# The Caitlyn Renderer
Caitlyn is a Monte Carlo ray tracer built in C++ by a team of students from UWaterloo and Wilfrid Laurier. It is currently being developed towards the visual style originally inspired by the Odd Tales' game, "The Last Night". The project is currently being co-run by Connor Loi and Samuel Bai :D
